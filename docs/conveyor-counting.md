# Conveyor Counting — method and limits

Zero-shot object counting on conveyor footage. Overview and results in the
[repository README](../README.md).

---

Counting and classifying objects on conveyor belts **without training a single
class**. Objects are found from plain-English text prompts, given stable IDs by
a multi-object tracker, and counted as they cross a line drawn with
[supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision).

Three Pexels clips are processed end to end: two fruit lines (oranges,
tomatoes) and one parcel belt.

## How each clip is configured

Every clip is one `ClipConfig` in `../src/conveyor_count.py`. Belt direction is
measured from tracked-object displacement, not eyeballed. All three belts run
left, so all three lines sit near-vertical — but each is tilted to be square to
its own belt rather than to the frame.

| Clip | conf | min_track_age | Motion (px/frame) | Line tilt off vertical | ROI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| oranges | 0.095 | 4 | (−3.2, +0.9) | 16.4° | full frame |
| tomatoes | 0.059 | 3 | (−14.8, −2.5) | 9.4° | y < 0.70 |
| parcels | 0.15 | 4 | (−1.5, +0.1) | 3.0° | x > 0.34 |

### Threshold tuning is clip-specific, and often not the answer

`../src/tune_thresholds.py` measures **entry lag**: how far into the frame an object
travels before the pipeline locks onto it. 0.00 means caught at the edge, 0.30
means it was already 30% across. Lowering `conf` and opening the tracker gates
helps one clip a lot and the other two barely at all:

| Clip | entry lag before → after | acquired within 15% of edge | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| tomatoes | 0.326 → **0.203** | 21% → **50%** | real win |
| oranges | 0.303 → 0.276 | 22% → 15% | mostly fragments |
| parcels | 0.559 → 0.546 | 20% → 17% | no effect |

On the oranges, dropping `conf` 2.2× nearly doubled the track count while the
share acquired early *fell* — the extra detections were fragments of objects
already tracked, not earlier pickups, so the settings were left moderate.

The parcels number is a measurement artefact worth knowing about: that clip's
entry lag is dominated by the **stationary pallet stack**, which is present from
frame 1 and never "enters" the frame at all. Belt items are in fact acquired
close to the right edge. A latency metric over all tracks quietly measures the
furniture unless static objects are excluded.

### Prompting: the prompt list defines what exists

The most useful thing measured here, and the easiest way to get a silently wrong
count. **An object type nobody named is not missed — it is invisible.** Nothing
in the output flags it.

The parcel belt is the live example. It ran for several passes with
`cardboard box`, `parcel`, `plastic bag`, and a black holdall sat on the belt
undetected the whole time: against those three prompts its best overlap with any
predicted box was **IoU 0.01**. It is fabric, so `plastic bag` never matched it.
It was not a threshold, ROI or size problem — the bag sits inside the ROI, fills
~1.5% of frame, and stayed invisible even at `conf=0.04`.

What fixed it is not what you would guess. Measured against the bag's true box:

| Prompt | IoU | conf |
|---|---|---|
| `sports bag` | 0.81 | 0.56 |
| `duffel bag` | 0.81 | 0.41 |
| `holdall` | 0.81 | 0.46 |
| `black object` | 0.00 | — |
| `luggage` | 0.00 | — |

`black object` is an accurate description and finds nothing; `holdall` is an
obscure word and works. What matters is how close the phrase sits to a concrete
object category, not how correctly it describes the thing.

The same effect showed up on two manufacturing clips that have since been
removed from this repo: `beer can`/`soda can`/`tin can` returned **0.0**
det/frame on a canning line where `shiny metal cylinder` returned 19.0 at
conf 0.66, and `chocolate`/`praline`/`chocolate bar` returned **0.0** on a
confectionery belt where `brown cube` returned 6.0 at conf 0.65.

Two rules that follow:

1. Build the prompt list from an inventory of what can travel the belt, not from
   whatever happens to be visible in the frames you calibrate on.
2. If a prompt returns nothing, try neighbouring nouns and a shape/colour/material
   description before concluding the model cannot see the object.

The limit is transparency. A PET bottle-preform clip was dropped after 15
prompts — `plastic bottle preform`, `test tube`, `transparent cylinder`,
`clear plastic cylinder` and others all peaked at **conf 0.13**, too low to
track. Clear objects on cluttered backgrounds are where this runs out.

### Counting rules

Two rules decide what becomes a count:

**The line is built from the belt, not from the frame axes.** Each clip stores
its measured `motion`, and `build_counting_line()` lays the line perpendicular
to it, then orders the endpoints so travel along `motion` registers as **IN**.
A line parallel to the travel direction would hardly be crossed at all, which is
why orientation follows the belt. The total is `in_count` alone;
`count_reverse_crossings` in `summary.json` records backward crossings, which on
a one-way conveyor should be near zero — a few mean box jitter or an ID switch
briefly threw a centroid back over the line, and they are excluded from the
total rather than netted against it.

**An object must be locked before it can count.** `min_track_age = 6`: the
tracker has to hold the same ID for six consecutive frames before that object is
eligible. Locked tracks are drawn with `[L]`. A box that flickers into existence
on top of the line cannot register a crossing — it has to be acquired early,
held, and only then counted as it passes.

The ROI is drawn on the output as a dashed box, so what was and was not counted
is visible rather than implied.

## Notes from getting this working

Four things that were not obvious and are worth keeping:

1. **TrackTrack's defaults reject zero-shot detections.** Stock thresholds are
   `track_high_thresh: 0.6` / `new_track_thresh: 0.7`, but open-vocabulary YOLOE
   scores on this footage run ~0.10–0.65. With defaults almost no track is ever
   created. `../src/trackers/tracktrack_zeroshot.yaml` moves the gates down to
   0.22 / 0.28 and documents each change against its stock value.
2. **ReID `model: auto` crashes on YOLOE `*-seg` checkpoints.** The native path
   (`get_obj_feats`) permutes a 4-D feature map, but the segmentation head
   returns a 3-D one → `RuntimeError: permute(sparse_coo)`. Fixed by pointing
   ReID at an explicit backbone (`yolo11n-cls.pt`), which keeps appearance
   re-identification instead of silently dropping it.
3. **Prompt aliases double-count without class-agnostic NMS.** `orange` and
   `round orange fruit` fire on the same fruit with different class ids, so
   class-wise NMS keeps both. `agnostic_nms=True` collapses them, and all
   aliases are then relabelled to one counting class.
4. **Input resolution matters far more than model size here.** At `imgsz=640`
   the fruit is too small; going to `imgsz=1280` roughly doubled mean confidence
   (e.g. oranges 0.17 → 0.33) for ~4× the compute. Measured, not assumed.

## Caveats

- Counts are line-crossing counts on short clips (7–17 s); they are not a
  validated ground truth, and no clip here ships with one.
- Encoding is `mp4v` — this sandbox has no ffmpeg/H.264 encoder, so the files
  are MPEG-4 Part 2. Plays in VLC/QuickTime; re-encode if you need H.264.
- CPU-only: ~1.3 s/frame at `imgsz=1280`. On a GPU this is real-time territory.
